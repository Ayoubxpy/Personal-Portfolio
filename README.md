# Personal Portfolio – Ayoub Loudini

This is my personal portfolio website built with **React**.  
It presents a simple profile layout with information about me, my interests, and links to my social platforms.

This project was built as part of my learning journey in web development.

## 📚 About This Project

I built this project to practice:
- React components
- Layout and spacing with CSS
- Structuring a small project from start to finish
- Debugging real layout issues (margin, padding, overflow)

The goal was not to build something complex, but to build something **clean, complete, and understandable**.

- Improve accessibility
- Add a Projects section
